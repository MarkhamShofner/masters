Course Overview,
  - In many organizations in the private and the public sectors, there is a need to support complex decisions that include a game-theoretic aspect. These decisions impact activities ranging from tactical to strategic, and play out in a number of problems, including monitoring and management of ongoing operations, the dynamics of organizational relationships in the competitive environment, and military force planning. This course extends treatment of game theoretic concepts and constructs, and explores their implementation and application, highlighting key issues such as decision space exploration and analysis, visualization, and the creation and use of models for specific domains. Students will have the opportunity to design a course project based on their area of professional or personal interest.

  • Describe the problems and motivations associated with effective support to decision makers in a complex multi-player environment.
  • Explain the specific information needs and technology challenges associated with providing effective
  decision support based on game theoretic constructs.
  • Discuss the relevance of game theoretic concepts to many domains of interest to the public and private
  sector.
  • Explain and use the fundamental concepts of decision support and game theory.
  • Apply data modeling, analytic techniques and systems engineering principles to relevant domains.
  • Architect and implement solutions based on the concepts studied.

Module 2 - Survey: Applications of Game Theoretic Concepts,
  - Describe the problems and motivations associated with effective support to decision makers in a complex multi-player environment, and the application of game-theoretic concepts
  +;
Normal Form,
  payoff matrix illustration
  +;
Tree diagram,
  tool for illustrating and analyzing games, especially games in which players act sequentially
  +;
Rules of the game,
  - players: #, interests (matching/conflicting)
  - information: complete, symmetric, perfect
  - actions/strategies
  - payoffs
  +;
Perfect vs. Imperfect Information,
  Perfect information means that no moves are simultaneous, and each player knows the sequence of moves and where players move
  +;
Dominant strategy,
  player will get the best possible payoff regardless of what the other player(s) will do
