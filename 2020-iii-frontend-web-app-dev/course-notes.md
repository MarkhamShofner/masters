Module 1: HTML5,
  - previously: block v inline
    - block: render to begin on a new line by default
    - inline: render on the same line
  - html5 (roughly): flow content v phrasing content
  +;

Module 2: CSS,
  - element with class selector (selector.class)
  - child (direct) selector (selector > selector)
  - descendent selector (selector selector)
  - box-sizing: border-box (preferred to content-box)
  - floating elements can in some cases lead to nicer flow of the document
  - relative v absolute positioning
  +;
Pseudo-selectors,
  :link
  :visited
  :hover
  :active
  :nth-child(n)
  etc
  a:hover, a:active etc...
  +;
