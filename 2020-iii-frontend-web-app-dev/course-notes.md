Module 1: HTML5,
  - previously: block v inline
    - block: render to begin on a new line by default
    - inline: render on the same line
  - html5 (roughly): flow content v phrasing content
  +;

Module 2: CSS,
  - element with class selector (selector.class)
  - child (direct) selector (selector > selector)
  - descendent selector (selector selector)
  - box-sizing: border-box (preferred to content-box)
  - floating elements can in some cases lead to nicer flow of the document
  - relative v absolute positioning
  +;
Pseudo-selectors,
  :link
  :visited
  :hover
  :active
  :nth-child(n)
  etc
  a:hover, a:active etc...
  +;

  Mod 3: Bootstrap,
    look at docs

  Mod 6: Filters DigestCycle ControllerInheritance and CustomServices,
    We will start this module by learning how to use Angular filters to manipulate our data into the format we want and learn how to create our own custom filters. We will then dive deep into the digest cycle, which is the process AngularJS uses to magically update our web page with the bound data from our ViewModel or the controller. Understanding this process is crucial in getting comfortable with AngularJS. We'll also see some cases where we'll need to assist that process somewhat and understand why that is. After that, we'll learn one of the most fundamental concepts in the Javascript programming language, which is Prototypal Inheritance. Clear understanding of that topic is a must before we talk about inheritance between AngularJS controllers in our application. We'll finish off the module by learning how to create our own custom Angular services as well as how to configure them. With custom Angular services we'll be able to share data across different controllers or other components in our application. We will also learn a few useful Angular directives that allow us to place looping and conditional logic direction into our HTML. You'll see that by the end of this module, you'll have the skills to create a fairly sophisticated web application that starts to use some of the more advanced software architecture techniques.
