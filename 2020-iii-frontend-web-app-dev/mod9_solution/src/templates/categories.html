<div>This is categories content</div>
- [#TODO]: categories view should list all available categories of items on the menu.
    - Each listing should be a link. Clicking that link should take the user to the /items view.
    - Note that since what the items view state shows is dependent on which category the user clicked, the URL mapping will need to have a parameter in it. I.e., don't take the URLs I am listing in the assignment description as literal URLs. They are just naming hints.
