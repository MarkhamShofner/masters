If you don't want to use the default, you may provide your preferred frequency table in the ../InputFiles/FreqTable.txt file if you want to override, or create a new frequency table file (e.g. ../InputFiles/MyFreqTable.txt) and then change that portion of the main method.
Similar process for the ../InputFiles/Encoded.txt and ../InputFiles/ClearText.txt files.
The DecodedMessage, EncodedMessage, and HuffmanTree can all be found in the ../OutputFiles/ directory.
