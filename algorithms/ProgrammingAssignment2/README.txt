Java Version - 8
IDE - NetBeans

Note:
- To interact with the algorithms, search for "[USER]" in the main file. You will be able to:
  - change which input data file you wish to use
  - change the type of pivot you wish to use

Data files may be formatted with delimiters being spaces, carriage returns, or new lines, but there are two requirements
 - manually add a delimiter at the end of the data files so that the program picks up the last integer
 - in the file name, change the 20k --> 20000 (5k --> 5000, etc...) to simplify the file read logic

Some of this code, including the bones of the quicksort pseudo code and the Stack.java and StackNode.java classes were pulled from a project assignment that I worked on in my Data Structures course last year.

Files read from the /InputData directory and write to the /OutputData directory.
