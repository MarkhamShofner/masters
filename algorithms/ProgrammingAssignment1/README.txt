///// Command line args are - <data1000.file> <algorithmType>
///// Algorithm types may be quick1, quick2, quick3, quick4, and heap.,
/////
///// Data files may be formatted with delimiters being spaces, carriage returns, or new lines, but there are two requirements
/////  - manually add a delimiter at the end of the data files so that the program picks up the last integer
/////  - in the file name, change the 20k --> 20000 (5k --> 5000, etc...) to simplify the file read logic
/////
///// Files read from the /InputData directory and write to the /OutputData directory.
